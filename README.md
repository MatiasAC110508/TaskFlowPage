**Task Manager JS – Simple Documentation**

This JavaScript file is used to manage a task list.

Features / Purpose:

Add tasks with Title, Description, Status, and Importance

Edit existing tasks

Delete tasks

Hide tasks that are In Progress from the table

Save tasks in localStorage so they persist after page reload

Hide the table if there are no visible tasks

How it works:

User enters task data in the form.

Task is saved to localStorage.

Task is displayed in the table (unless it’s “In Progress”).

User can edit or delete tasks.

Table updates automatically and hides if empty.
